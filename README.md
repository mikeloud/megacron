# megacron
Script that checks a folder for files and uploads them to mega.
It also deletes them from your local folder after uploading. Remember that.

Since megatools cannot delete files and folders after uploading them through megacopy, this script does that.

Requires:

* megatools

Suggested:

* cron for setting a cronjob that checks a folder periodically
